# Project Title
## EkiTracker

# Project Proposal

EkiTracker is for people who want to get into running but don't know where to start, named after the Hakone Ekiden, one of the most prominent college racing competitions. Enjoying running requires lifestyle changes and preparation, and this app will guide users through that process. Users can set a date and time when they plan to run, and the app will guide them through the pre-run, during-run and post-run process to make sure that new runners are prepared and safe. The app will potentially keep track of miles logged on shoes and notify the user when it's time to get new shoes. It could also log basic data such as personal records, total miles run, and weekly streaks to encourage continued running.

### Before the Run
EkiTracker estimates how much water the user needs to drink and reminds them starting the day before their run. Prior to running, the app should guide the user through stretching to prevent injury.

### The Run
The user can select from a set of basic guided runs (ie. tempo run, long run, basic run, easy run, interval training).

### After the Run
EkiTracker suggests post-run stretches, potentially recommends post-run meals, and how long to rest before running again.

## Target Audience
This app is meant to be a gateway into the running community which has all the information a beginner needs to start running. As someone who has gotten into running recently, many of this app's features are attempting to teach people lessons I learned the hard way.

## How?
This project works best as a mobile app. Hydration reminders would fit in on a mobile device where people are familiar with recieving notifications. Phones have GPS and people bring their phones everywhere, making it suitable for run tracking. Other features such as stretching guides, scheduled runs, and personal data work best on a mobile device where an internet connection is not required, and activities can be done anywhere at any time.

## Scope
There are many running apps already out there that log personal stats, have social features, and record health data. These features could easily snowball, but are also tangential to the point of this project, which is to consolidate all the information a beginner needs to start running for the first time. Because many running apps already exist, EkiTracker can focus on the core features of pre-run, during-run and post-run guidance.
