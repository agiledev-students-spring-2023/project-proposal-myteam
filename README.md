# Project Proposal
## The Desert
### Team
Ian Nacke

### What and Why
The Desert is an augmented reality experience that transports users to another world. The project makes the user's phone a window into a world without any buildings. Users would be able to look through their phones at any time and see a desert landscape that follows the topography of the real world. The user would hear sounds of wind and sand, and the environment would be lit by a day night cycle that reflects the current irl time. The Desert reframes the smart phone experience as a calm, meditative one rather than a fast-paced, goal oriented one.

### For Whom?
The project is open-ended and artistic. As someone who was inspired by artistic video games as a kid, I want this project to inspire children to see the potential of art and technology. I want this app to be accessible for my friends and family who are not proficient with technology or video games.

### How?
The project would use the geographical topology data at the user's GPS location to generate a landscape matching the user's surroundings, but without buildings or other features. Using time (and possibly weather) information, the scene can be lit according to the conditions in the real world to strengthen the connection between the real world and the virtual one.  

### Scope
There are many elements of the natural world that are challenging to replicate in a virtual space, especially because it has to be done procedurally (to decorate the infinite possible locations in the world that this app could be used in). To avoid this complexity, the landscape should be strictly desert. A desert is a fitting immersive aesthetic, with long flat expanses that contrast the tall buildings and obstructions surrounding us in the real world. In a desert environment, development can focus more on connecting the virtual world to the real world rather than on making an aesthetically pleasing virtual world.
